# Display markdown files as html

This is a proof of concept to display markdown files as HTML.
It integrates the nice [Showdown](http://showdownjs.com/) library with Spring framework.

You can check some working example below: 
- Local [MD files](./docs/ReadMe.md) that are in the resource folder of the code
- Some external [MD files](./gitDocs/ReadMe.md) that are stored on github
